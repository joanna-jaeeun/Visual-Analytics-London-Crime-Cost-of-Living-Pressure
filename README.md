## Project Story
The aim of this project is to analyze students' handwritten emotion diaries and provide personalized feedback based on the results. 
This year, a third-grade homeroom teacher, I noticed that my students often got into conflicts and showed strong emotional reactions. I believe that keeping a diary is a powerful way for students to be honest with themselves and to build a private channel of communication between teachers and students. By using emotion diaries, I aim to better understand their emotional states and peer relationships, ultimately supporting their personal growth. Technically, the project focuses on NLP and LLM techniques, including sentiment analysis with BERT and prompt engineering to extract targeted insights. Additionally, Neo4j was used to figure out nuanced relationship and Streamlit were used to visualize outcomes, making the project more intuitive and engaging.
